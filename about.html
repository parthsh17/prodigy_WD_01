        <h1>About Webkings</h1>
        <p>
          Webkings is a web development agency that started in 2020 by three
          friends in college in India. Their journey began with a passion for
          technology and a dream to build something impactful. Facing numerous
          challenges, from tight budgets to learning the ropes of business
          management, they persevered with dedication and innovation.

        <p>
          The first challenge was securing initial clients. With a lack of
          experience, the trio had to rely on personal networks and offer
          competitive rates to gain trust. They also had to balance their
          academic commitments with their budding business, often working late
          into the night on projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          As their skills improved and their portfolio grew, Webkings began
          attracting more attention. They expanded their services, taking on
          larger and more complex projects. The team faced technical challenges,
          but their collaborative spirit and problem-solving abilities saw them
          through.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2024, Webkings had established itself as a reputable name in the
          web development industry, known for delivering high-quality websites
          and applications. The friends' journey from college students to
          successful entrepreneurs is a testament to their hard work and vision.
